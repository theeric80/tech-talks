Here’s the preliminary code development workflow based on our discussion:

## Code Development Workflow
1. Development Phase
    * The engineer creates a feature branch.
    * The engineer commits code and corresponding test cases to the branch.
2. Pull Request (PR) Phase
    * The engineer creates a PR.
    * The engineer requests a Reviewer and AI to review the PR.
    * PR validation includes:
        * Manual Review:
            * The reviewer checks for code quality and verifies the completeness and correctness of the test cases.
        * CI Validation: Automated checks are run:
            * Build execution.
            * SonarQube analysis.
            * Whitebox test execution.
            * Verification of test coverage > 30%.
3. Review Decision
    * The reviewer evaluates the combined results of the code review and CI validation.
    * The reviewer decides whether to approve the PR.
4. Merge
    * If the PR is approved, the code is merged into the target branch.

### The preliminary development workflow follows the CC backend team’s process, with a few key differences:
* Development Phase: In the current process, committing test cases with code is optional. In the proposed workflow, it is mandatory.
* Pull Request Phase: AI review is currently optional. In the proposed workflow, AI review is mandatory.
* CI Validation:
    * Current workflow focuses whitebox testing primarily on regression; proposed workflow validates new changes as well.
    * Current workflow does not enforce code coverage thresholds; proposed workflow requires >30% code coverage.

### How AI Enhances Quality and Efficiency
* AI-Assisted Code Review
    * AI provides an immediate summary of code changes, highlights major modifications, and recommends potential improvements.
    * Reduces manual review effort and improves review consistency.
* AI-Assisted Whitebox Testing
    * AI helps generate comprehensive test cases, covering both expected (“happy path”) and edge/failure (“sad path”) scenarios, increasing coverage and reducing risk of undetected bugs.
    * Reduces manual effort required to write tests, accelerates test creation and increases engineering efficiency.

### Regarding SonarQube Replacement
* SonarQube is the industry-standard, rule-based tool that enforces coding standards, identifies known anti-patterns, and provides reliable static code analysis; I think it should remain the core CI quality gate, while AI-driven tools can be explored as a supplement to address any of its shortcomings.
